        <h1>FFXIV In Brief</h1>
        <p><a href="https://www.finalfantasyxiv.com/">Final Fantasy XIV</a> (FFXIV) is a Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (MMORPG) developed by Square Enix.<br><br>
            When it originally released in 2010 the game was considered a <strong>complete failure</strong> and almost bankrupted the company, however due to a number of emergency leadership changes the game was able to be saved and relaunched in 2012 to critical acclaim.<br>
            In the years since the game has gone on to become one of the highest grossing MMORPG titles on the market and is highly regarded among the fans as one of <strong>the best</strong> MMORPG titles to ever release.<br>
